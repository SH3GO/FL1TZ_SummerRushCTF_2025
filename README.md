Task 2: Operation SILENT CHAIN 1  
The folder password is the previous flag : SC_Alpha15
The recovered email dated [2025-07-10 22:50Z] – Comms Channel Update referenced a secondary channel for secure comms.

Flag: FL1TZ{@syriaobserver}


Task 3: Operation SILENT CHAIN 2  
The alias @syriaobserver was mentioned as active on technical forums, hinting at a digital footprint tied to code or tool distribution.
Following this trail led to a GitHub account with multiple repositories. One repository, net_watchdog, contained a lightweight Python tool for sysadmins.
Inside the source code and configs, a file named OPSEC_Notes.txt revealed the operative’s real identity

Task 4 : Operation SILENT CHAIN 3  
David Holmes’s GitHub account contained a repository AstraNet (Corporate Solution), which included a contact file revealing the CEO’s first name (Richard) and that his last name starts with V.

Using David’s full name and the company name, and following the instruction to “follow Holmes’s professional footprint and technical contributions,” his LinkedIn account was located.

Task 5: Operation SILENT CHAIN 4  
A leaked email from Richard Vance authorized a high-priority air transfer.
The aircraft was a Gulfstream G650, chartered through Gama Aviation.
Following the trail, the key was Gama Aviation’s website: searching for the G650 led to an article showing the plane with its registration number N650GA.

From there, all other details about the aircraft, including its registered owner and manufacturer serial number, were easily traceable(just google it).

Task 6: Operation SILENT CHAIN 5  
The final task provided a corrupted image. Opening it in a hex editor and removing all junk data outside the JPEG header (FF D8) and footer (FF D9) revealed a photo of an abandoned house in the desert.

At the bottom of the image, a code was visible 37SBV3944144639 , which turned out to be MGRS coordinates. Decoding these coordinates with any online tool gave the latitude and longitude, yielding the last flag.
